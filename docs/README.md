# Questions and Answers

Questions & Answers is a VTEX IO native solution that allows shoppers to submit questions and answers for products, as well as see them while navigating the store.


## Configuration

### Installing the Questions and Answers app

Using your terminal, log in to the desired VTEX account and run the following command:

`vtex install vtex.questions-and-answers@0.x`

### Declaring the app's blocks in your store theme

Once the app is configured, place the `questions-and-answers` block in your Store Theme app.

## Modus Operandi

The app may be configured to use a **moderation interface** where an administrator is responsible for approving the reviews before they are displayed on the store website.

To access and use the review moderation admin interface, follow the instructions below:

1. Enable the **Require Admin Approval** setting.
2. In the admin dashboard, navigate to **Catalog > Questions and Answers** using the admin's sidebar.
3. You may view either **Pending Items** or **Approved Items** using the tabs at the top of the page.

## Customization

In order to apply CSS customizations in this and other blocks, follow the instructions given in the recipe on [Using CSS Handles for store customization](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/style/using-css-handles-for-store-customization).
